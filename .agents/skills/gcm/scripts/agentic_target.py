"""The agentic targets of the commit gates: `just review`, `just test-review`, `just update-docs`, `just prose`,
`just visual-check` and `just visualize`.

`agentic_target.py render TARGET [ARGS...]` prints an `AGENT_TASK v1` packet for a fresh agent. `jagt render` writes
the packet, with a nonce, and saves the packet file in `packets/` of the shared log folder. The record of the result
comes later, from the `SubagentStop` hook or from `just record`.

The prompt of the packet has three layers, in this order:

1. The base task: `references/targets/TARGET.md` in the one installed skill that has it, for example the `grv`
   skill for `review` or the `nossaifd` skill for `prose`.
2. A language layer for each language of `.agents/stack.json`: `.agents/targets/LANGUAGE/TARGET.md`, when the
   profile of the language ships it.
3. The repository text: `.agents/targets/TARGET.md`, when the repository has it.

The input is the diff of the worktree against HEAD, with the files that git does not track yet and does not
ignore. The tree of the worktree comes from a copy of the index, as in the gate, so a file that the index holds
counts even when `.gitignore` names it. The diff is in `diffs/HEAD-TREE.diff` of the shared log folder, where HEAD
is the commit of HEAD, or `none`, and TREE is the worktree tree.

It exits with 0 when it printed the packet, and with 1 when not.
